# This is a small challenge to learn more about how blocks work in Ruby. Think about methods for a second. You call a method with data from the outside world — the method's arguments — that the code inside your method can see and use.

# If arguments are how we pass in data into ours method, blocks are how we pass in behavior. Think of them as a chunk of logic or a "brain" that your method can yield to.

# Blocks can be passed into methods as a sort of "invisible argument", like this:

# def print_result
#   block_execution = yield
#   puts block_execution
# end

# # This will print out the number 9 to the console
# print_result { 3 * 3 }

# # Blocks can also be written using the do...end format
# print_result do
#   creature = "walrus"
#   "I am the #{creature}!"
# end

# # Blocks have access to variables outside of their definition

# shopping_list = [:milk, :eggs, :cheese]
# print_result do
#   important_item = shopping_list.sample
#   "I hope I don't forget #{important_item}!!!"
# end
# As you will notice, the call to yield in the method definition is where the block is executed.

# Let's write something practical using blocks. A common scenario is wanting to benchmark some code. The "skeleton" involved in benchmarking doesn't need to know what it's benchmarking, but it should be responsible for keeping track of how long it's running and other benchmarking-specific concerns.

# That is, it shouldn't care whether we're benchmarking a simple function to add two numbers or something much more complicated.

# Without blocks we might write code like this:

# start_time = Time.now

# # Calculate the 100th Fibonacci number
# fibonacci(100)

# end_time = Time.now

# # This will return the difference in the timestamps in seconds
# running_time = end_time - start_time

# puts "fibonacci(100) took #{running_time} seconds."
# Let's use blocks to create a benchmark method that can benchmark anything.

# Objectives
# Write the benchmark method
# Write a benchmark method which takes a block and returns the running time (in seconds) of that block. It should work like this:

# # Be careful, pasting this into IRB will take a long time to print.
# # It's a loooong string. :)
# long_string = "apple"*100000000

# running_time = benchmark { long_string.reverse }

# puts "string.reverse took #{running_time} seconds to run"
